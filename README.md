# Food Calorie Estimator (Text-Based)

A Python-based calorie estimator that predicts calorie counts from dish names using a trained machine learning model. The project trains over 4 sequential epochs and saves the final model as `final_model.pt`, optimized to balance accuracy while avoiding underfitting and overfitting.

## Features
- Text-based calorie prediction from food names
- Sequential training over 4 epochs
- Saves final trained model (`final_model.pt`)
- Simple and lightweight Python implementation

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Food-Calorie-Estimator.git
   
cd Food-Calorie-Estimator

pip install -r requirements.txt

python train.py

python predict.py "Chicken Biryani"

Model Access

The trained model file (final_model.pt) is not included in this repository.
